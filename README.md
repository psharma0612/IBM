ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project was completed as part of my IBM Data Science course assignment, where the goal was to extract, clean, and analyze financial data for Tesla and GameStop, and build dashboards to compare stock prices with company revenue.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights

Data Extraction:

Collected Tesla and GameStop stock price data using the yfinance library.

Scraped quarterly revenue data for both companies using web scraping (BeautifulSoup).

Data Cleaning & Preparation:

Removed missing and inconsistent values from the datasets.

Converted raw financial data into structured DataFrames for analysis.

Data Visualization:

Created dashboards to compare stock prices with quarterly revenues.

Tesla Dashboard: Stock price trends vs revenue growth.

GameStop Dashboard: Stock price changes vs revenue patterns.

Documentation & Sharing:

Compiled the entire workflow in a Jupyter Notebook with code, outputs, and visualizations.

Final notebook prepared for submission and peer review.

ðŸš€ Skills & Tools Used

Python Libraries: yfinance, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Matplotlib

Techniques: Data extraction, web scraping, data cleaning, financial data analysis

Visualization: Dashboard creation to show stock vs revenue insights

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome

This project strengthened my ability to work with real-world financial data, apply Python-based data science techniques, and communicate insights effectively using visual dashboards. It simulated how data scientists in the finance sector extract and analyze data for investment research.
